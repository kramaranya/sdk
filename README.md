## Overview

Kubeflow SDK is a unified Python SDK that streamlines the user experience for AI Practitioners to interact with various
Kubeflow projects. It provides simple, consistent APIs across the Kubeflow ecosystem, enabling users to focus on building
ML applications rather than managing complex infrastrutcure.

> **Note**: The Kubeflow SDK is in active development. Currently, the SDK provides full support for **Kubeflow
Trainer** with other components planned for future releases.

### Kubeflow SDK Benefits

- **Unified Experience**: Single SDK to interact with multiple Kubeflow components through consistent Python APIs
- **Simplified ML Workflows**: Abstract away Kubernetes complexity, allowing ML practitioners to work in familiar Python environments
- **Seamless Integration**: Designed to work together with all Kubeflow projects for end-to-end ML pipelines
- **Local Development**: First-class support for local development requiring only `pip` installation

## Installation

Install the Kubeflow SDK using pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/kubeflow/sdk.git@main
```
